# Execute Plan

## Overview

Execute a pre-approved plan with strict adherence to scope, sequence, and verification.

Typical input: a plan path such as `docs/plans/YYMMDD-HHmm-<plan-slug>/SUMMARY.md`.

Do not redesign the plan during execution. If ambiguity or blockers appear, stop and ask via `AskUserQuestion`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Initialize

1. **Locate Plan**
   - Confirm the plan path exists and is readable.
   - If a directory is provided, locate `SUMMARY.md` inside it.

2. **Load Execution Context**
   - Read project context when relevant: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`, plus the plan's phase files.
   - Review phase dependencies before starting.

3. **Select Execution Mode**
   - Default mode: **Batch**
   - Use **Interactive** when any of the following is true:
     - High-risk changes (auth, payments, migrations, security-critical logic)
     - Irreversible operations (data migrations, destructive scripts)
     - Unclear acceptance criteria
     - User explicitly requests checkpoints
   - If mode is unclear, ask once via `AskUserQuestion` and proceed with user choice.

4. **Find Next Pending Phase**
   - First `[ ]` phase
   - If none, first `[-]` phase
   - If no pending/in-progress phases remain, go to final verification.

5. **Critical Plan Sanity Check**
   - Ensure each phase has:
     - clear objective
     - file targets
     - verification commands
   - If essential details are missing or contradictory, stop and request clarification.

### Step 2: Execute Per-Phase Loop

For each phase in order:

1. **Skip Completed**
   - If status is `[x]`, continue to next phase.

2. **Mark In Progress**
   - Update phase status to `[-]` before making changes.

3. **Execute Exactly**
   - Implement only the tasks defined in that phase.
   - Do not expand scope without approval.
   - Write the minimum code that satisfies the phase. No speculative features, no abstractions for single-use code, no error handling for impossible scenarios. See **Simplicity first** and **Surgical changes** rules below.

4. **Verify Phase**
   - Run the phase-specific verification commands from the plan.
   - At minimum, run relevant tests/checks tied to touched files.

5. **Handle Failures**
   - If verification fails:
     - Attempt focused fixes within phase scope.
     - Re-run verification.
   - If still failing or root cause is outside scope, stop and report blocker.

6. **Mark Complete**
   - Update phase status to `[x]` only after verification passes.

7. **Progress Report**
   - **Interactive mode:** report and wait for confirmation before next phase.
   - **Batch mode:** report briefly and continue immediately.

### Step 3: Final Verification

After all phases are complete:

1. **Project-Wide Validation**
   - Run full lint/type-check suite
   - Run all relevant tests (or full test suite if required by the plan)
   - Run build verification if applicable

2. **Stabilize**
   - Fix regressions introduced during execution.
   - Re-run failed checks until green or blocked.

3. **Manual Validation Checkpoint**
   - If user/manual QA is required, ask explicitly via `AskUserQuestion` and pause:
     - `Verified` to accept
     - or provide feedback for follow-up iteration

### Step 4: Completion Artifacts

1. **Documentation Sync**
   - If behavior/architecture/codebase expectations changed, update the relevant `docs/` files (or hand off to the `docs` skill).
2. **Create Execution Report**
   - File: `docs/plans/YYMMDD-HHmm-<plan-slug>/EXECUTION-REPORT.md`
   - Include: Plan reference, Phases completed with status, Files changed, Verification commands run + outcomes, Deviations from plan (with rationale), Residual risks / follow-ups.

3. **Archive Plan Folder**
   - Move the plan folder to `docs/plans/archived/` after the execution report is created.

4. **Announce Completion**
   - Output: `Execution complete. Report archived at docs/plans/archived/YYMMDD-HHmm-<plan-slug>/EXECUTION-REPORT.md.`

### Step 5: Final Confirmation Gate

After completion artifacts are done, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` with these options:

- `Confirm: End session`
- `Confirm and Auto commit git`
- `Confirm and update documentation`
- `Confirm and update documentation and auto commit git`
- `Need verify`

Handle the selected option as follows:

1. **`Confirm: End session`** — End the execution session.
2. **`Confirm and Auto commit git`** — Invoke the `git-commit` skill, complete the commit flow, then end the session.
3. **`Confirm and update documentation`** — Invoke the `docs` skill to sync documentation, then end the session.
4. **`Confirm and update documentation and auto commit git`** — Invoke `docs`, then `git-commit`, then end the session.
5. **`Need verify`** — Allow the user to provide verification feedback/details. Continue the execution loop to address feedback, then re-run verification and completion steps as needed.

## Rules

- **Respect project standards**: follow `docs/` and related project docs.
- **Follow the plan strictly**: no silent scope changes.
- **Stop on blocker**: missing dependency, contradictory instructions, or unexplained failures.
- **No guessing**: ask via `AskUserQuestion` when uncertain.
- **Verify before complete**: never mark phase done without passing checks.
- **Idempotency**: prefer safe/re-runnable operations.
- **Simplicity first**: Implement the minimum code that satisfies the phase's exit criteria. No features beyond what the plan asks for. No abstractions for single-use code. No configurability that wasn't requested. If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- **Surgical changes**: Touch only what the phase requires. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Don't refactor things that aren't broken. Match existing style even if you'd do it differently. Only remove imports/variables/functions that *your* changes orphaned — don't delete pre-existing dead code unless the plan asks for it. Every changed line should trace to a phase task.
- **Do not skip workflow steps**: initialization, per-phase verification, final verification, and reporting are all mandatory.
