name: brainstorm
description: Collaborative discovery and design framing for ambiguous or high-risk work. Use when requirements are unclear, multiple approaches are possible, or you need to turn an idea into a validated design brief before planning or coding.

# Brainstorm

## Overview

Use this skill to convert rough ideas into clear, reviewable design outputs through structured dialogue.

The goal is to:

1. Clarify requirements and constraints
2. Explore alternatives with trade-offs
3. Produce a concrete, validated design brief in artifacts or a handoff to planning

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Project Context

Read project documentation when relevant: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`, plus key implementation files relevant to the idea. Note constraints from existing architecture, dependencies, and conventions.

Keep this pass focused. Only gather what is needed for the current idea.

### Step 2: Clarify Requirements

Use `AskUserQuestion` to remove ambiguity. Ask targeted questions, one focused topic at a time.

Focus on:

- Objective and user value
- Scope boundaries
- Constraints (technical, UX, performance, timeline)
- Success criteria
- Non-goals

Do not jump to implementation details too early.

### Step 3: Explore Approaches

Propose 2-5 viable approaches.

For each approach, include:

- Short summary
- Pros
- Cons / risks
- Complexity estimate
- Recommended use conditions

Lead with your recommended option and explain why it best fits the project context and constraints.

After presenting all approaches, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick their preferred approach. List the summary options like:

1. Approach A — short summary (Recommended)
2. Approach B — short summary
3. Approach C — short summary

Mark the recommended approach with "(Recommended)" to guide the user.

### Step 4: Present the Design Incrementally

Once requirements are clear, present the design incrementally in logical phases (about 200-300 words per phase) to avoid overwhelming the user.

- **Phase 1: Foundation** — Problem framing, goals, and proposed architecture/flow.
- **Phase 2: Technical Details** — Data model, interfaces, error handling, and edge cases.
- **Phase 3: Delivery** — Testing/verification strategy and rollout considerations (if applicable).

After presenting **each phase**, use `AskUserQuestion` immediately to ask whether to:

1. Proceed to the next phase
2. Adjust the current phase
3. Revisit a previous phase

### Step 5: Close the Loop

After you and the user have worked through requirements and the design is validated, determine the next actions.

1. Use `AskUserQuestion` to present three high-level next actions:
   - "Write plan immediately (in current context)" — skip the artifact step and move straight to a `write-plan` handoff.
   - "Write artifacts" — continue by authoring the brainstorm documents described in Step 6.
   - "End session (already provided enough information for user)" — stop; the conversation has produced enough insight for now.

2. If the user picks **Write artifacts**, proceed to Step 6. Once the draft artifacts exist, use `AskUserQuestion` again to validate them with options:
   - "Write plan with current artifacts, context"
   - "End session — artifacts are sufficient for now"
   - "Need changes" — collect the feedback, revise the artifacts, and re-ask.

3. If the user picked **Write plan immediately**, initiate a handoff to use skill `write-plan` using the current brainstorming context; no additional artifact validation is required.

4. If the user picked **End session**, simply stop. The information collected so far is considered sufficient.

### Step 6 (optional): Write Brainstorm Artifacts

Only perform this step after the user has explicitly chosen "Write artifacts" during Step 5.

Persist results to the standardized location:

- Directory: `docs/brainstorms/YYMMDD-HHmm-<topic-slug>/`
- Main file (required): `docs/brainstorms/YYMMDD-HHmm-<topic-slug>/SUMMARY.md`
- Optional supporting files:
  - `docs/brainstorms/YYMMDD-HHmm-<topic-slug>/section-01-<slug>.md`
  - `docs/brainstorms/YYMMDD-HHmm-<topic-slug>/section-02-<slug>.md`
  - etc.

`SUMMARY.md` should contain: Problem framing, Goals & non-goals, Constraints & assumptions, Approaches considered (with pros/cons), Recommended approach with rationale, Open questions, and Next steps.

## Rules

- Do not write production code or make implementation changes in the brainstorm session.
- Keep interaction lightweight and iterative; every step should be run in the same session.
- Prefer clarity over completeness when uncertain; ask a follow-up question.
- Align all recommendations with project documentation and standards.
- Keep assumptions explicit; do not guess silently.
- **Think before coding:** Surface assumptions explicitly. If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently. If a simpler approach exists, say so and push back when warranted.
